# ImageProcessing
The image processing project using C and C++. Various operations like cropping, applying filters, rotating, merging two images etc.Required 1 month to complete the project.
The images that have been generated can be viewed using a PNM file reader software which can be downloaded online.

Commands to run 3A: (basic reading,drawing an yellow diagonal and writing the image to another file)
To build the project:
```
make
```
To test the project with an input test image named "3A_input.pnm". We can see the output image created in the file "3A-output.pnm":
```
./Proj3A 3A_input.pnm 3A-output.pnm
```

Commands to run 3B: (blend, left-right combine, top-bottom combine half-size)
To build the project:
```
make
```
To test the project with an input test image named "3A_input.pnm". We can see the output image created in the file "3B-output.pnm". Other images for each filter will be created automatically.:
```
./Proj3A 3B_input.pnm 3B_output.pnm
```

Commands to run 3C: (object oriented programming implementation in c++ of the previous functions in the provided inheritance structure)
To build the project:
```
make
```
To test the project with an input test image named "3A_input.pnm". We can see the output image created in the file "3C-output.pnm". Other images for each filter will be created automatically.:
```
./Proj3A 3B_input.pnm 3B_output.pnm
```
Commands to run 3E: (Data flow network design without the need to call the execute method)
To build the project:
```
make
```
To test the project with an input test image named "3A_input.pnm". We can see the output image created in the file "3E-output.pnm". Other images for each filter will be created automatically.:
```
./Proj3A 3B_input.pnm 3E_output.pnm
```
